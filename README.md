            <h2>About Hiranandani Hospital Kidney Transplant</h2>
            <p><a href=""https://www.hiranandanihospital.org/>Dr. L.H. Hiranandani Hospital</a> is one of the top hospitals in Thane West and Powai, Maharashtra. It has a team of highly skilled doctors who provide comprehensive care to patients. The hospital was founded in February 2004 in honor of the legendary Dr. L.H. Hiranandani, who received the Padma Bhushan award. <br><br>
In the early days, the hospital faced significant challenges in establishing itself as a leading healthcare institution in the country. The hospital recognized that to make a meaningful contribution, it needed to redefine the standards of healthcare rather than following the same practices as others. This approach guided the hospital towards ambitious solutions, services, teamwork, and quality.
<br><br>
The hospital's efforts paid off quickly. In 2007, it became the first hospital in Western India to receive the prestigious NABH Accreditation for Hospitals and Healthcare providers, which was awarded to only eight hospitals in the country at that time. In 2008, the hospital received the IMC Ramakrishna Bajaj National Quality Award for excellence in healthcare. In 2009, the hospital was the proud recipient of the coveted International Asia Pacific Quality Award (also known as the Malcolm Baldridge Award in the United States).</p>
